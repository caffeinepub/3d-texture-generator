  "summary": "The implementation covers all five requirements with reasonable fidelity. The backend actor (REQ-1) stores presets with material type, name, parameters, and timestamp. The frontend provides a Texture Generator page with 8 material categories, parameter sliders, and a 3D sphere preview with OrbitControls (REQ-2). Export panel generates and downloads Albedo, Normal, Roughness, and Metalness PNG maps at 512x512 (REQ-3). A Presets Library with save dialog, load, and delete is implemented and connected to the backend (REQ-4). A dark industrial theme with amber accents, monospace typography, and panel-based layout is applied throughout (REQ-5). One minor gap is that ceramic and concrete material types are frontend-only extended types and cannot be persisted as backend presets with their own MaterialType variant.",
